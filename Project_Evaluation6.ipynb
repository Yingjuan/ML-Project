    "Project Description: \n",
    "In this project, we will explore the relationship between a movie’s theatrical revenue and other key features. We will use worldwide box-office gross (numerical) as the target variable, and use relevant information that are available prior a movie's release as input variables, including general information like number of critic reviews, duration of movie (in mins), face number in poster, genres, budget, country, content-rating, imdb score, as well as social media factors like number of director facebook likes, number of cast total facebook likes, etc. \n",

    "The objective of this project is to build a regression model to predict movie box office gross. Categorical input variables include genres, country, and content-rating; numerical input variables are number of critic reviews, duration, face number in poster, budget, imdb score, number of director facebook likes, and number of cast total facebook likes.
